Seng 384 Project - HealthTech Co-Creation &amp; Innovation Platform

## Project Purpose
Multidisciplinary health-tech innovation requires rapid and structured access to complementary expertise. Engineers developing healthcare technologies require clinical domain knowledge, workflow understanding, validation processes, and ethical approval pathways. Conversely, healthcare professionals often generate strong innovation ideas but lack engineering competence to implement them. Currently, such partnerships depend largely on personal networks or coincidence.  

The HEALTH AI co-creation platform eliminates randomness in interdisciplinary collaboration by providing: 

- Structured announcement-based partner discovery 
- Secure first-contact initiation 
- Controlled disclosure of ideas 
- Transparent meeting workflow 
- Clear closure of partner requests 

The objective is to develop a secure, GDPR-compliant web platform that enables structured partner discovery between healthcare professionals and engineers, with usability as the highest priority requirement.
